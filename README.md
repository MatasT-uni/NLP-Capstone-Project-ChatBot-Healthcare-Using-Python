# Healthcare Chatbot: Question Answering

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the capstone project titled "Healthcare Chatbot: Question Answering." The project aims to develop a healthcare chatbot that utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically T5-large and GPT-2 large, to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries related to healthcare. The chatbot is designed to answer questions by leveraging these state-of-the-art language models, ensuring a high level of understanding and interaction.

## Project Overview

The chatbot is built to assist users by answering healthcare-related questions. The project involves data scraping, model setup, and deployment of two different NLP models—T5-large and GPT-2 large. The chatbot's primary function is to generate text-based responses that are both informative and accurate, catering to the needs of users seeking medical information.

### Key Components

1. **Data Scraping and Processing**:
   - Scrapes healthcare data from reliable sources using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
   - Preprocesses the data to ensure relevance and quality before feeding it into the models.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - **T5-large Model**: Configured to generate concise and quick responses, ideal for scenarios requiring rapid answers.
   - **GPT-2 large Model**: Configured to provide more detailed and context-rich answers, suitable for complex queries.

3. **Chatbot Interaction**:
   - Users can choose between the T5-large and GPT-2 large models depending on their preference for response style and detail.
   - The chatbot interface allows for seamless interaction, providing answers based on the user’s input.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - The chatbot’s responses are evaluated based on accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.
   - Comparative analysis is conducted to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model in the context of the chatbot.

### Notebook Structure

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Essential libraries such as `transformers`, `torch`, `nltk`, `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup` are imported to handle data processing, model implementation, and interaction.

2. **Setup for Scraped Data**:
   - Mechanisms for scraping and processing data from healthcare-related websites are implemented to ensure the chatbot has access to up-to-date and relevant information.

3. **Model Setup**:
   - Detailed configurations for the T5-large and GPT-2 large models, including necessary tokenization and padding settings.
   - Functions for generating answers using both models based on user queries.

4. **Chatbot Interaction**:
   - Interactive section where users can input their queries and receive responses from the chatbot using either T5-large or GPT-2 large.
   - Sample interactions and feedback analysis are included to demonstrate the chatbot’s capabilities.

5. **Evaluation and Results**:
   - Analysis of the chatbot's performance, including speed, accuracy, and the quality of responses.
   - Comparisons between the two models and their effectiveness in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the `.ipynb` file.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For handling the deep learning models.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatasT-uni/NLP-Capstone-Project-ChatBot-Healthcare-Using-Python
   cd NLP-Capstone-Project-ChatBot-Healthcare-Using-Python
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to set up the chatbot and interact with it.

## Usage

- **Run the notebook** to initialize the chatbot and start interacting with it.
- **Choose a model**: Decide between T5-large for quicker responses or GPT-2 large for more detailed answers.
- **Ask questions**: Input your healthcare-related questions and receive responses generated by the selected model.

## Results

The project successfully demonstrates the application of advanced NLP models in a chatbot framework. The T5-large model excels in providing quick and concise responses, while the GPT-2 large model offers more detailed and context-rich answers. The chatbot effectively leverages these models to deliver high-quality healthcare information to users.
