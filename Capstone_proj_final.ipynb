            "  - AA amyloidosis is one type of the rare disorder amyloidosis (pronounced “am-uh-loy-doh-sis”). Amyloidosis happens when proteins in your body lose their three-dimensional (3D) structure and become twisted clumps of misshapen fibrils (amyloid deposits) that gather on your organs and tissues.\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis is also known as secondary amyloidosis or amyloid serum A protein. This amyloidosis type happens when you have high levels of inflammation in your body that boost the serum A protein levels in your bloodstream. You may have high serum A protein levels if you have a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease. In a sense, AA amyloidosis is a serious complication of inflammatory diseases and conditions. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by controlling the underlying disease or condition.\n",
            "Section: How does AA amyloidosis affect my body?\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis can damage several of your organs, including yourkidneys(most common),liver,spleen,stomachand intestines. Rarely, AA amyloidosis damages your heart. AA amyloidosis may also affect the amount of protein in your pee and your cholesterol levels.\n",
            "Section: Is AA amyloidosis terminal?\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis can be a terminal illness if it isn’t treated. You may develop AA amyloidosis if you have a chronic illness that causes inflammation. When healthcare providers treat the underlying condition, they’re also treating AA amyloidosis.\n",
            "Section: Who is affected by AA amyloidosis?\n",
            "  - Anyone who has a chronic inflammatory condition can develop AA amyloidosis.\n",
            "Section: What causes AA amyloidosis?\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis. Healthcare providers call amyloidosis a “protein misfolding disorder.” Your proteins are long molecules that form 3D structures. They’re multitaskers that do everything from providing energy, balancing fluids and helping with immunity to providing structure, carrying material and regulating your body’s processes.\n",
            "  - Normally, proteins leave your bloodstream once they finish their assigned tasks. In protein misfolding disorders, proteins take on abnormal shapes that can’t be removed and your body can’t use. In AA amyloidosis, the abnormal proteins clump together, making amyloid deposits or fibrils that collect in your organs.\n",
            "  - Recent studies have identified dozens of medical conditions that cause AA amyloidosis. Those conditions include certain blood cancers, bacterial infections from diseases like chronic ulcers to rheumatic diseases such asrheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel diseases likeCrohn’s diseaseorulcerative colitis. People may inherit conditions that cause AA amyloidosis, including periodic fever syndromes such as Familial Mediterranean Fever.\n",
            "Section: What are AA amyloidosis symptoms?\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis often affects your kidneys. It may also affect your liver, spleen and stomach. Some common symptoms and conditions that may be signs of AA amyloidosis include:\n",
            "  - Swollen feet or legs that may be symptoms of kidney problems,including chronic kidney disease.\n",
            "  - Foamy or frothy pee.\n",
            "  - Peeing less than usual.\n",
            "  - Chronic diarrhea.\n",

            "Section: How do healthcare providers diagnose AA amyloidosis?\n",
            "  - Healthcare providers may do a series of biopsies to diagnose AA amyloidosis:\n",
            "  - “Fat pad” biopsy: Providers take a small sample of abdominal fat just under your skin.\n",
            "  - Organ biopsy: Providers take a small sample of tissue from the affected organ.\n",
            "  - Providers may do other tests to rule outAL amyloidosis, which is another amyloidosis type. AL amyloidosis and AA amyloidosis have similar symptoms, but AL amyloidosis is a more aggressive form of amyloidosis.\n",
            "Section: How do healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis?\n",
            "  - AA amyloidosis happens because you have a chronic inflammatory condition that caused abnormal proteins to gather in clumps on your organs. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying inflammatory condition. By treating the underlying condition, providers reduce the inflammation that caused AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis symptoms ease as inflammation levels drop.\n",
            "  - They may also use medications that treat active AA amyloidosis. Providers and researchers are developing additional AA amyloidosis treatments that may clear amyloid fibrils from your bloodstream before the fibril can build on your organs. They’re also developing lab-made antibodies to target and clear amyloid fibrils already lodged in organs.\n",
            "Section: Can I prevent AA amyloidosis?\n",
            "  - You may develop AA amyloidosis if you have a chronic inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis that increases the amount of a certain protein in your bloodstream. As such, the only way you can prevent AA amyloidosis is to seek timely treatment for underlying chronic inflammatory diseases.\n",
            "Section: Is AA amyloidosis curable?\n",
            "  - Yes, healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying inflammatory condition that causes AA amyloidosis. Like many illnesses, the key to managing AA amyloidosis is to diagnose and treat early on.\n",
            "Section: How do I take care of myself?\n",
            "  - If you have AA amyloidosis, you can take care of yourself by working with your healthcare provider to treat the underlying inflammatory condition that caused AA amyloidosis. Researchers have identified dozens of diseases and conditions that cause long-lasting inflammation linked to AA amyloidosis. Ask your healthcare provider to explain how your condition caused AA amyloidosis and how they’ll treat your inflammatory condition.\n",
            "  - A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
            "  - In a sense, AA amyloidosis is a very rare and serious complication to dozens of common inflammatory diseases or conditions. Fortunately, healthcare providers can treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying condition. Many times, AA amyloidosis symptoms may seem like common problems you’re used to managing as part of your specific inflammatory disease or condition. But like many serious illnesses, healthcare providers can do more to treat AA amyloidosis when they catch the condition in its early stages. Talk to your provider if you notice changes in your inflammatory disease or condition. They’ll be glad to evaluate your symptoms and explain what they mean.\n",

            "  - Aphlebotomisttakes a blood sample from your vein and sends it to a lab for analysis (the most common form of the test).\n",
            "  - A provider gets a sample of your blood from a finger prick. They usually get the results from this test within minutes. This form of the test is only for assessing your management, not for diagnosis.\n",
            "  - The vein blood test is generally more accurate than the finger prick blood test.\n",
            "  - Other names for an A1C test include:\n",

            "  - Glycohemoglobin test.\n",
            "Section: What is blood glucose (sugar)?\n",
            "  - Glucose (sugar) mainly comes fromcarbohydratesin the food and drinks you consume. It’s your body’s main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body’s cells to use for energy.\n",
            "  - Several bodily processes help keep your blood glucose in a healthy range.Insulin, a hormone yourpancreasmakes, is the most significant contributor to maintaining healthy blood sugar.\n",
            "  - If you have consistently elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) — and an elevated A1C result — it usually indicates diabetes. Diabetes develops when your pancreas doesn’t make any insulin or enough insulin, or your body isn’t using insulin properly.\n",
            "Section: When would I need an A1C test?\n",
            "  - If you have diabetes, you should have an A1C test two or more times a year to see how well your management plan is working. Your healthcare team will recommend exactly how often you should get this test.\n",
            "  - If you don’t have a diabetes diagnosis, a healthcare provider may order an A1C test if you have symptoms of the condition, including:\n",
            "  - Intense thirst (polydipsia).\n",
            "  - Increased urination(peeing).\n",
            "  - Blurry vision.\n",

            "  - Family history of Type 2 diabetes.\n",
            "  - Personal history ofgestational diabetes.\n",
            "  - Obesity.\n",
            "  - Lack of activity or exercise.\n",
            "  - Being over the age of 35.\n",
            "Section: How is A1C calculated?\n",
            "  - A1C testing relies on hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of thered blood cellthat carries oxygen throughout your body. When you have glucose in your blood, it sticks to hemoglobin. This is called glycation. The more glucose is in your blood, the more it sticks. And it can stay there for around three months — about how long the average red blood cell lives.\n",
            "  - The A1C test measures the average amount of glucose that’s been attached to hemoglobin over time. Because the A1C test measures glucose levels over a period of time, it provides more information about blood sugar than a single blood sugar test.\n",
            "Section: Do I need to fast for an A1C test?\n",
            "  - No, you don’t need to fast before getting an A1C test.\n",

            "  - You can expect the following during an A1C test that involves a sample from your vein, or a blood draw:\n",
            "  - You’ll sit in a chair, and a phlebotomist will check your arms for an easily accessible vein. This is usually in the inner part of your arm on the other side of your elbow.\n",
            "  - Once they’ve located a vein, they’ll clean and disinfect the area.\n",
            "  - They’ll then insert a small needle into your vein to take a blood sample. This may feel like a small pinch.\n",
            "  - After they insert the needle, a small amount of blood will collect in a test tube.\n",
            "  - Once they have enough blood to test, they’ll remove the needle and hold a cotton ball or gauze on the site to stop the bleeding.\n",
            "  - Finally, they’ll place a bandage over the site, and you’ll be finished.\n",
            "  - You can expect the following during a finger prick A1C test:\n",
            "  - A healthcare provider will ask you which finger you’d like them to use.\n",
            "  - They’ll disinfect your fingertip with an alcohol swab and prick it with a small needle called a lancet, which is usually contained within a small plastic device.\n",
            "  - They’ll squeeze your fingertip to form a drop of blood and collect the drop in a small plastic container.\n",
            "  - After they have enough blood for the test, they’ll give you a cotton ball or gauze to hold against your fingertip to stop the bleeding.\n",
            "  - The results are usually ready within minutes.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks of an A1C test?\n",
            "  - Blood tests are a very common and essential part of medical testing and screening. There’s very little risk to having either type of A1C test. You may have slight tenderness or abruiseat the site of the blood draw or finger prick, but this usually resolves quickly.\n",
            "Section: What does my A1C mean?\n",
            "  - An A1C test result is reported as a percentage. The number represents the portion of hemoglobin proteins that are glycated, or holding glucose. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been over the last few months.\n",
            "  - For diagnosing purposes, an A1C level of:\n",
            "  - Less than 5.7% means you don’t have diabetes.\n",
            "  - 5.7% to 6.4% signals prediabetes.\n",
            "  - 6.5% or higher usually indicates Type 2 diabetes (or Type 1 diabetes).\n",
            "  - If you already have diabetes, an A1C result is a glimpse into how well your management plan has been working over the last three months. Management may involve oral pills, taking insulin, monitoring blood sugar levels and/or lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise. Your A1C can help you and your provider determine if you should adjust any part of your treatment plan.\n",
            "  - It’s important to remember that your A1C (if you have diabetes) is just an average measurement of your blood sugar over a few months. It’s not a grade or the ultimate determiner of whether you’re living a healthy life. Know that your A1C will change over your lifetime and that there are steps you can take to improve your diabetes management and A1C level, if needed.\n",
            "Section: A1C and estimated average glucose (eAG)\n",
            "  - Some laboratories report your A1C results as a percentage in addition to the corresponding estimated average glucose (eAG).\n",
            "  - The eAG calculation converts the A1C percentage to the same units you use with at-home glucose meters (glucometers) — milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Just like your A1C is an average, the eAG is a single number that represents your average blood sugar level over the past three months.\n",
            "  - For example, an A1C level of 7% equates to an eAG of 154 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L). An A1C level of 9% equates to an eAG of 212 mg/dL (11.8 mmol/L).\n",
            "Section: What is a normal A1C?\n",
            "  - For people without diabetes, a normal A1C is below 5.7%.\n",
            "  - For people with diabetes, what’s “normal” and healthy for you depends on your goals and access to diabetes management medication and tools. Together, you and your healthcare provider will determine an A1C range that should be your target goal. This will likely change throughout your life.\n",
            "  - In general, the American Diabetes Association recommends that the goal for most adults with diabetes should be an A1C of 7% or lower.\n",

            "  - Nasal endoscopy.During this test, your child’s healthcare provider inserts a flexible tube into your child’s nose. The tube has a light and camera on the end so they can look at the adenoids directly. This way, they can tell if your child’s adenoids are red, inflamed or enlarged.\n",
            "  - Bacteria culture test.To see if enlarged adenoids are the result of an infection, your child’s healthcare provider may take a throat culture. This test determines which organisms or bacteria are present.\n",

            "Section: Treat the underlying condition\n",
            "  - Once your healthcare provider figures out what’s causing enlarged adenoids, they can begin by treating the root cause. For example, if your child’s adenoids are enlarged because ofallergies, then your child’s healthcare provider may prescribeantihistaminesor a nasalcorticosteroidspray. If your child’s adenoids are inflamed due to a bacterial infection, then they’ll likely prescribeantibiotics.\n",
            "Section: Adenoidectomy\n",
            "  - If nonsurgical methods don’t fix the issue, then your healthcare provider might recommend an adenoidectomy — a surgery to remove your child’s adenoids.\n",
            "  - During this outpatient procedure, your child’s surgeon removes your child’s adenoids under generalanesthesia. They might do this with traditional instruments or cautery.\n",

            "  - A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
            "  - Adenoids are tiny glands with a big job. They help keep your child healthy until their body finds other ways to fight off germs. Sometimes though, adenoids can become enlarged or inflamed. Nasal steroid sprays, antihistamines, antibiotics and other medications can usually address the issue. But if your child has chronically enlarged adenoids, your child’s healthcare provider may recommend an adenoidectomy. Ask your child’s healthcare provider which treatment option is best for your child.\n",

            "  - Stratum basale (stratum germinativum; pronounced stray-tum bay-say-lee or stray-tum germ-in-a-tie-vum).The stratum basale is in the deepest layer of your epidermis. New skin cells develop in this layer. It also contains the keratinocyte (cur-at-in-o-site) stem cells, which produce the protein keratin. Keratin helps form hair, nails and your skin’s outer layer, which protect you from the harsh environment. It also contains melanocytes (mel-ann-o-sites), which are responsible for producing melanin, which provides the pigment of your epidermis.\n",
            "  - Stratum spinosum (pronounced stray-tum spin-o-sum).The stratum spinosum is between the stratum basale and granulosum layers. This layer mostly consists of keratinocytes held together by sticky proteins called desmosomes (dez-mo-soam). The stratum spinosum helps make your skin flexible and strong.\n",
            "  - Stratum granulosum (pronounced stray-tum gran-yoo-lo-sum).The stratum granulosum is between the stratum spinosum layer and the stratum lucidum layer. Keratinocytes have granules within them, which are visible under a microscope in this layer.\n",
            "  - Stratum lucidum (pronounced stray-tum loo-sid-um).The stratum lucidum is between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum. It’s a thin, transparent layer of keratinocytes that are becoming less round and have a flatter shape.\n",
            "  - Stratum corneum (pronounced stray-tum corn-ee-um).The stratum corneum is the top layer of the epidermis. This is the layer you see. In the stratum corneum, keratinocytes become corneocytes (corn-ee-o-site). Corneocytes are strong, dead keratinocytes that protect you from harm, including abrasions, light, heat and pathogens. This layer also consists of fats that keep water from easily entering or leaving your body. The corneocytes eventually shed as new keratinocyte cells develop in the stratum basale layer and move through the other layers of skin.\n",

            "  - Hydration. The outermost layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) holds in water and keeps your skin hydrated and healthy.\n",
            "  - Producing new skin cells. New skin cells develop at the bottom layer of your epidermis (stratum basale) and travel up through the other layers as they get older. They reach the outermost layer of your epidermis after about a month, where the skin cells shed from your body as new cells develop at the bottom layer.\n",
            "  - Protection. The epidermis acts like armor to protect your body from harm, includingultraviolet (UV) radiation, pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) and chemicals.\n",

Your provider or surgeon will focus on treating your whole injury, which will involve the cartilage.\n",
            "  - Some cartilage injuries heal on their own with rest and time, but others require surgery (usually anarthroscopy) to repair. Your surgeon might stitch your cartilage back together, but they also might reshape it (you might see this referred to as trimming or shaving) to restore its function. Talk to your provider or surgeon about what to expect and how long it will take to recover.\n",

With a decidual cast, the entire lining of your uterus sheds in one piece at one time. It even takes on the shape of your uterus (an upside down pear or an upside down triangle).\n",
            "  - To better understand a decidual cast, it’s helpful to know what’s going on inside your uterus during yourmenstrual cycle. Over the course of your cycle, your endometrium (lining of your uterus) thickens up. This happens because your body is preparing your uterus for a potentialpregnancy. If you don’t get pregnant that cycle, you get your period. This now thick lining sheds over several days, a little bit at a time. With a decidual cast, this thick lining is expelled from your uterus in one large piece of tissue instead of gradually.\n",

            "  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t a single disease. There are many different types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These types have the same kinds of symptoms. However, each type of lymphoma may affect your body in different ways. For example, some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than other types. Some types affect organs like your spleen and liver while other types affect your skin.\n",
            "  - Some non-Hodgkin lymphomas may affect your lymphatic system and your ability to fight infection. Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, vessels andlymph nodes that works with your immune system. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas happen whenwhite blood cellsknown as lymphocytes mutate or change.\n",
            "  - These cells include B cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The normal function of B cells is to makeantibodiesthat fight bacteria and infections. T cells target viruses and other foreign cells and help B cells make antibodies. NK cells attack some cancer cells and viruses. Healthcare providers classifylymphomasaccording to the type of white blood cell in which a lymphoma starts. About 85% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas start in B cells.\n",
            "  - When these cells mutate, they continuously multiply, eventually becomingtumors. Since your lymphatic system touches nearly every part of your body, non-Hodgkin lymphoma frequently spreads from where it started to other areas of your body. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas may grow slowly (indolent) or spread very quickly (aggressive).\n",

            "  - Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): This is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for about 30% of all cases in the U.S. DLBCL grows very quickly and may start inlymph nodesor in other parts of your body. Medical researchers have identified three different DLBCL subgroups. These are germinal center B-cell-like (GCB), activated B-cell-like (ABC) and unclassified. GBC and ABC have several different genetic subtypes and react to chemotherapy in different ways.\n",
            "  - Mantle cell lymphoma: This type happens when a B cell located in the so-called mantle zone of a lymph node mutates. It accounts for about 5% to 7% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and typically affects males/people DMAB age 60 and older. While mantle cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, there are times when it grows more slowly. This typically happens in older people who have lymphoma in their spleen and lymphoma cells in their bloodstream.\n",

            "  - Watchful waiting/active surveillance: If you have a type of indolent or slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma but don’t have symptoms, your provider may hold off on medications or other treatments. This is called watchful waiting or active surveillance. Providers carefully monitor your overall health so they’re ready to start treatment as soon as you have symptoms.\n",
            "  - Traditional systemicchemotherapy: These drugs attack cancer cells throughout your body. Most traditional chemotherapy drugs are given intravenously and sometimes have side effects such as nausea, hair loss or low numbers of normal blood cells.\n",
            "  - Targeted therapy: These include treatments such asmonoclonal antibody therapy. This treatment uses lab-created antibodies to find and destroy specific cancer cells.\n",
            "  - Immunotherapy:This treatment, also called biologic therapy or biotherapy, boosts your body’s immune system.CAR-T cell therapyis an example of immunotherapy, although many healthcare providers also view monoclonal antibodies as a type of immunotherapy as well.\n",

            "  - Yes, people who have treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphomas go into remission.Remissionmeans they don’t have any symptoms and tests show they don’t have signs of the condition. Some people are considered to be cured because they’ve remained in remission for many years. Sometimes non-Hodgkin lymphomas come back. Studies show most aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas come back during the first two years after treatment, or they never come back.\n",
            "  - It’s important to remember that not everyone diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma ultimately dies from it, even if the condition can’t be cured.\n",

            "  - There are two reasons why your condition may come back:\n",
            "  - Your treatment didn’t eliminate the condition.\n",
            "  - Your condition went into remission and then came back or relapsed. This may happen because treatment eliminated fast-growing cells but left slow-growing cells behind.\n",
            "Section: Can my healthcare provider estimate the chance my condition will come back?\n",
            "  - Yes, they can. For example, if you have an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your healthcare provider may use the International Prognostic Index (IPI), one of several risk-scoring tools. The index is based on factors such as your age, non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage and certain blood test results.\n",
            "Section: What’s it like to live with non-Hodgkin lymphoma?\n",
            "  - For some people, living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma means their treatment eliminated the cancer cells and they're cured. This is more common after treatment for aggressive lymphoma. Other people may have this condition for the rest of their lives. It’s important to remember that with some forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, many people have normal (or near normal) quality of life. It’s just as important to remember that not everyone who's diagnosed ultimately dies from it, even if the condition can’t be cured.\n",

            "  - You may feel anxious because you can’t be sure you won’t get sick again. If that’s your situation, talk to your provider. They may have information to make you worry less. They may also have resources to help you manage your emotions.\n",
            "Section: Living with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n",
            "  - Some people with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma will need continuous treatment. Other people may need occasional treatment. In both cases, however, these people will still have a non-Hodgkin lymphoma and will need some form of treatment for the rest of their lives.\n",
            "  - It’s not easy to live with a chronic disease that’s likely to get worse as time goes by. If you are living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may want to explorepalliative care. Palliative care provides symptom relief, comfort and support to people living with serious medical conditions.\n",
            "Section: What can I do to manage my condition?\n",
            "  - You can manage your condition in several ways. These activities won’t make your condition go away, but they may help you feel more confident about living with it:\n",
            "  - Eat healthy meals:Food is energy. Eating well is one way to maintain strength. Ask to speak to a nutritionist if you’d like more information or ideas about eating well.\n",
            "  - Rest as much as you can:You may feel worn out by chemotherapy and other treatments. Rest helps your body recover and regain strength.\n",
            "  - Manage your stress:It’s not easy to live with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You may wonder how the condition and treatment will affect your daily life. You may be worried about your prognosis. Talk to your provider if you’re spending time and emotional energy worrying about your situation. They’ll answer your questions and recommend programs, like support groups, that may help.\n",

            "Section: What is macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - Macrocytosis is a word that describes abnormally largered blood cells. It’s not a condition or diagnosis. Instead, you may learn that you have enlarged red blood cells when you receive results from acomplete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine blood test providers use to monitor your health by examining your blood cells.\n",
            "  - A CBC includes a value calledmean corpuscular volume (MCV), the average size of your red blood cells. You have macrocytosis if you’re an adult with an MCV above what’s considered normal — 100 femtoliters (fL).\n",
            "  - Macrocytosis isn’t usually a sign of something serious. Sometimes, though, enlarged red blood cells lack the essential nutrients they need to do their job — transporting oxygen throughout your body. This is what happens withmacrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia can lead to serious health issues without treatment.\n",
            "Section: How common is macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - Approximately 2% to 4% of people have macrocytosis. Over half of the people with macrocytosis (60%) also have anemia.\n",
            "  - Macrocytosis without anemia is more common in infants, older adults and people who are pregnant. It doesn’t usually require treatment.\n",
            "Section: What are the symptoms of macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - Often, the only sign of macrocytosis is a high MCV value on a CBC, which means you have enlarged red blood cells. When symptoms appear, they’re related to what’s causing your red blood cells to be large.\n",
            "  - For example, with macrocytic anemia, you may have commonanemiasymptoms like weakness or pale skin. If the cause is a nutritional deficiency, you may experience symptoms likediarrheaor problems with memory orbalance.\n",
            "  - Symptoms are as varied as causes.\n",
            "Section: What causes macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - Problems with red blood cell production in yourbone marrow(where blood cells are made) and structural problems with your red blood cells can lead to macrocytosis. You may have a high MCV because you have a lot of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood. Reticulocytes are larger than fully mature red blood cells.\n",
            "  - Causes of macrocytosis include:\n",
            "  - Nutritional deficiencies: Your body needs nutrients, like vitamin B12 and folate (vitamin B9), to make healthy red blood cells. Your red blood cells may not develop normally if you’re not consuming enough of these nutrients or if a condition is preventing your body from absorbing them. Deficiencies invitamin B12andfolatecause macrocytic anemia.\n",
            "  - Medications: Multiple medicines can lead to macrocytosis. The most common types include a medicine forsickle cell diseasecalledhydroxyurea, variouschemotherapy drugsforcancertreatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatingHIV.\n",
            "  - Alcohol use disorder: Drinking too much alcohol can prevent your body from absorbing the nutrients needed to make healthy red blood cells.\n",
            "  - Liver disease: Macrocytosis may be a sign of liver disease. Often — but not always — liver disease is related to consuming too much alcohol.\n",
            "  - Hemolytic anemia: With hemolytic anemia, an underlying condition causes your red blood cells to die too soon. When this happens, your body may release reticulocytes into your bloodstream to compensate. These immature red blood cells aren’t fully formed enough to successfully transport oxygen like mature red blood cells.\n",
            "  - Severe blood loss: Your body may release reticulocytes into your bloodstream if you lose large volumes of blood. As with hemolytic anemia, your body may release immature blood cells early to compensate for the lost blood cells.\n",
            "  - Myelodysplastic syndrome: This type of cancer prevents your bone marrow from producing healthy red blood cells.\n",
            "  - Hypothyroidism: People with this condition may have macrocytosis, with or without anemia.\n",
            "  - Sometimes, macrocytosis doesn’t have a clear cause. This is especially the case if you have macrocytosis but don’t have anemia.\n",
            "Section: How is macrocytosis diagnosed?\n",
            "  - Macrocytosis is a description of enlarged red blood cells, not an official diagnosis. Your red blood cells are larger than normal if the MCV result on a CBC is greater than 100 fL.\n",
            "  - Sometimes, healthcare providers can determine likely causes based on how severe your macrocytosis is. For example, an extremely high MCV (from 110 to 115 fL) often signals a severe form of macrocytic anemia calledmegaloblastic anemia.\n",
            "Section: What tests will be done to determine what’s causing macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - If your healthcare provider is concerned about your enlarged red blood cells, they may ask questions to determine the cause. They may ask about your medical history, including what prescription drugs you’re taking, your diet and alcohol consumption. They may perform additional tests, including:\n",
            "  - Peripheral blood smear: A healthcare provider will view your blood cells under a microscope. They’ll look for abnormalities related to issues that can lead to macrocytosis, like problems with blood cell development.\n",
            "  - Vitamin B12 and folate levels: Low levels of vitamin B12 or folate may signal that a nutritional deficiency is depriving your red blood cells of the ingredients needed to develop normally.\n",
            "  - Reticulocyte count:This test helps your provider determine if your high MCV is related to having many immature red blood cells in a blood sample.\n",
            "  - Liver function test:This test can help your provider determine how well your liver absorbs the nutrients needed to make healthy red blood cells.\n",
            "  - Bone marrow biopsy: Your provider may perform this procedure if they suspect you have a condition that’s interfering with red blood cell production in your bone marrow. They’ll remove a sample of your bone marrow and view the cells under a microscope to check for abnormalities.\n",
            "Section: How is macrocytosis treated?\n",
            "  - You may not need treatment, especially if you don’t have anemia symptoms and your test results don’t show any abnormalities. Otherwise, treatment depends on what’s causing your large red blood cells.\n",
            "  - If your macrocytosis is related to a nutritional deficiency, you may need to change your diet or take supplements. If the issue is related to a medication, your healthcare provider may adjust the dosage or prescribe a different type of medicine. You may need ablood transfusionif you have severe anemia along with macrocytosis.\n",
            "  - Follow your healthcare provider’s treatment plan based on what’s causing your macrocytosis.\n",
            "Section: Can you cure macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - Often, addressing the underlying cause reverses macrocytosis. Ask your healthcare provider about how treatments will likely impact your health.\n",
            "Section: How can I reduce my risk of having macrocytosis?\n",
            "  - You may not be able to prevent all potential causes of macrocytosis, but healthy habits can reduce your risk. For example, eating foods rich in vitamin B12 and folate — like fish, dairy and fortified cereals — can reduce your risk of macrocytic anemia. You can reduce your risk of macrocytosis bylimiting your alcohol consumption.\n",
            "  - Also, don’t skip annualblood tests. Macrocytosis is usually an incidental finding on routine blood work. Early diagnosis and treatment can often stop a condition from progressing into something serious.\n",
            "Section: What happens if macrocytosis is left untreated?\n",
            "  - Only a healthcare provider can determine whether your macrocytosis is cause for concern. If you have macrocytosis and anemia, it’s essential to get treated. Untreated macrocytic anemia can cause serious medical problems.\n",
            "Section: What questions should I ask my doctor?\n",
            "  - Follow your healthcare provider’s guidance about what steps to take if you learn that you have abnormally large red blood cells. Questions include:\n",

            "Section: What do the kidneys do?\n",
            "  - You have two kidneys, one on each side of your spine, in the back of your abdomen. Although you are born with two kidneys, you can live with only one, as long as it is functioning. Your kidneys cleanse your blood of toxins and change the waste into urine. They also keep your electrolytes and water content constant and secrete some essential hormones.\n",
            "Section: Who needs a nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - This surgery is necessary if you have kidney cancer, other kidney diseases or injuries, or because your kidney is getting donated fortransplant.\n",
            "Section: Is the procedure outpatient or inpatient?\n",
            "  - A radical nephrectomy is an inpatient procedure. You will have to stay in the hospital for one to seven days.\n",
            "Section: What happens before a radical nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - In the days before your operation, blood samples will be taken to tell your blood type in case you need a transfusion. Your healthcare provider might ask you to stop taking certain medications such as blood thinners. You will recover more quickly and are less likely to have a complication after surgery if you don’t smoke. You will be asked to not eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery. Your healthcare provider will give you instructions about any of your medicines that you should take the day of the surgery.\n",
            "Section: How is a radical nephrectomy done?\n",
            "  - Radical nephrectomies can by “open” or laparoscopic surgery. In an open surgery, there is one incision or opening. Laparoscopic surgeries are done with several smaller incisions. The surgeon uses an instrument called a laparoscope, which has a tiny camera on the end, to do the surgery. When the surgeon is ready to take out the kidney, he or she will make one of the cuts bigger.\n",
            "  - Laparoscopic procedures, which also are called minimally invasive surgeries, are now more common than open procedures. However, for larger tumors, for more complex cases, or whenever clearing out all the lymph nodes is required, an open procedure is often still the best approach.\n",
            "Section: Will I be asleep during the radical nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - Both laparoscopic and open nephrectomies are done under general anesthesia, meaning that you will be asleep during the operation.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks or complications of this procedure?\n",
            "  - Like all surgeries, a radical nephrectomy surgery can cause infection, bleeding, post-operative pneumonia, post-operative wounds and, rarely, an allergic reaction to the anesthesia.\n",

            "  - Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions about how to take care of yourself after your surgery.\n",
            "Section: What happens after a radical nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - When you’re out of surgery, your healthcare team will closely monitor your blood pressure and other body functions. You will be treated with pain medication. Shortly after surgery you will be asked to get out of bed and walk. This promotes healing and normal physical functions and also reduces the chance of some complications, including pneumonia. You might, for a short time, have a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) that will drain urine from your bladder.\n",
            "Section: How long does it take to recover from a radical nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - Full recovery, including the ability to lift and engage in strenuous activities, may take up to six weeks.\n",
            "Section: What is the long-term outlook for a person who has had a radical nephrectomy?\n",
            "  - Kidneys are important because they filter waste and excess water out of your body by making urine, and help to regulate your blood pressure. If both kidneys are removed, you will need a transplant or dialysis.\n",
            "  - If you still have one healthy kidney, it can typically do everything you need it to do. Your healthcare provider might make dietary suggestions and recommend that you exercise and have regular checkups. If you take part in contact sports, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider because it is very important to protect the remaining kidney.\n",
            "  - If a kidney is removed in childhood, there is a possibility of some loss of kidney function much later – usually at least 25 years later. However, this is usually mild and does not affect your lifespan.\n",
            "Section: When should I see my healthcare provider?\n",
            "  - After your surgery your remaining kidney will need to be tested every year. Tests will include a urine test and blood pressure check. If protein is in the urine, that may mean that there’s something wrong with your remaining kidney. Every few years you’ll have to test your kidney functions, measuring the creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n",

The fallopian tubes are the pathway for the egg to reach the uterus whenconceptionoccurs. Your fallopian tubes are located on the top and on either side of your uterus, almost like a set of horns.\n",

            "  - Women who have certain health conditions associated with their fallopian tubes may get a salpingectomy. It's also recommended for women with a high risk of developingbreast cancerand ovarian cancer due toBRCAgene mutations. Removing your fallopian tubes can help prevent women from getting these types of cancers because the most severe forms ofovarian canceroften begin in the fallopian tubes.\n",

            "  - Unilateral salpingectomy.Only one fallopian tube is removed. This means you may still become pregnant since you still have one working fallopian tube.\n",
            "  - Bilateral salpingectomy.This is when both fallopian tubes are removed. You wouldn't be able to get pregnant naturally, but IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is an option if you wish to become pregnant and still have a uterus.\n",
            "  - You may have part of the tube removed (partial salpingectomy) or the entire tube removed (total salpingectomy). For the purposes of sterilization, it is acceptable to perform either a partial or total bilateral salpingectomy. If the surgery is necessary for a health condition, then the entire fallopian tube is typically removed.\n",
            "Section: How do I prepare for a salpingectomy?\n",
            "  - Your healthcare provider will review the procedure with you and go over any instructions for pre-and post-operative care. Depending on the type of salpingectomy you're having, your age and other medical conditions, these instructions may vary. Make sure you understand the risks of a salpingectomy, the expected recovery time and how the procedure is performed.\n",

            "  - There are two types of salpingectomy surgical methods:\n",
            "  - Laparoscopic salpingectomy. A minimally invasive surgery performed using a laparoscope, a thin instrument with a light and camera at the end. It's inserted through the abdomen using a small incision. Your abdomen is then inflated with gas to allow the surgeon to see your uterus and fallopian tubes in detail. Finally, surgical tools are inserted through other small incisions in your abdomen to remove the fallopian tubes. After removing excess blood and fluid, your surgeon will close the incisions with stitches or medical glue.\n",
            "  - Open abdominal salpingectomy. One large incision is made across your abdomen (called alaparotomy). Your surgeon will be able to access your fallopian tubes through this incision. Once your surgeon removes the fallopian tubes, they stitch or staple the incision closed.\n",
            "  - Alaparoscopic approachis preferred because it's less invasive with a shorter recovery time and lower risk of complications. But an open approach may be necessary depending on other factors.\n",
            "Section: What happens after a salpingectomy?\n",
            "  - After a salpingectomy, you're taken to a recovery room for monitoring. If your surgery was performed laparoscopically, you might be able to go home the same day. If you had an open salpingectomy, you typically remain in the hospital overnight. Your healthcare provider will help you manage any pain or discomfort.\n",
            "  - The exact recovery time varies. Everyone heals at a different rate, but it's best to assume you'll need several days of rest after surgery.\n",
            "  - Before leaving the hospital or surgical center, make sure you receive post-operative instructions on when you can resume day-to-day activities like showering, using stairs, taking medications, driving, and returning to work.\n",
            "Section: What are the advantages of getting a salpingectomy?\n",
            "  - Salpingectomy treats certain medical conditions and prevents ovarian cancers in women who are at higher risk. The main benefit of the procedure is to relieve symptoms caused by conditions of the fallopian tubes and lower your risk of developing cancer. A salpingectomy can also offer permanent contraception so you will never become pregnant.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks of having a salpingectomy?\n",

            "  - Recovery takes longer if you had an open abdominal salpingectomy or additional procedures. You can expect a slower recovery that lasts four to six weeks. This is because your incision site may be sore or painful, making it a challenge to resume your normal activities. Talk to your healthcare provider about modifications you should be making during your recovery.\n",
            "  - Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations about activities to avoid after surgery, including things like sexual intercourse. You should avoid certain exercises, lifting heavy objects and anything that puts strain on your abdomen for at least two to six weeks, depending on the type of surgery you had.\n",
            "Section: Can I get pregnant after a salpingectomy?\n",
            "  - It depends on what type of salpingectomy you had. If you have a unilateral salpingectomy (only one fallopian tube is removed), you'll be able to get pregnant, assuming the other fallopian tube is still functioning. If both fallopian tubes are removed (bilateral salpingectomy), you are unable to get pregnant naturally.\n",
            "  - If you've had a salpingectomy, you can pursue an IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) pregnancy. IVF is a process that involves fertilizing your eggs in a lab, then transferring them into your uterus.\n",

            "Section: What's the difference between a salpingectomy and a tubal ligation?\n",
            "  - Tubal ligationis commonly referred to as \"getting your tubes tied\" This is misleading, as nothing is actually tied during a tubal ligation. Tubal ligation is any procedure that interrupts the fallopian tubes. This includes partial or total salpingectomy, placing clips or bands on the tubes, or cauterizing the tubes to cause scarring.\n",
            "Section: How is a salpingectomy different than an oophorectomy?\n",
            "  - Anoophorectomyis the removal of one or both of your ovaries, while a salpingectomy removes one or both of your fallopian tubes. Depending on your condition, your healthcare provider may perform both procedures at the same time. When one ovary and one fallopian tube are removed, it's called unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. If both fallopian tubes and both ovaries are removed simultaneously, it's called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n",

            "Section: What is the COVID vaccine?\n",
            "  - COVID vaccines are preventive treatments that train your body to recognize and quickly fight aCOVID-19 infection. This means if you’re exposed to COVID, you might not get sick or you’ll get less severely sick than you would have without vaccination.\n",
            "  - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO) authorized the first COVID vaccines for emergency use in 2020. They were effective against the original strain of COVID. Since then, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, has changed (mutated). New variants, like many Omicron subvariants, are different enough from the original strain that the first vaccines aren’t as effective against it. Some manufacturers have created updated vaccines that train your immune system to recognize new variants and continue to provide protection.\n",
            "Section: Are the new shots boosters?\n",
            "  - While many people call them “boosters,” the most recent COVID shots aren’t boosters. They’re vaccines that have been updated to target the most common variant. This is similar to how the flu shot is updated every year.\n",
            "  - Boosters are additional doses of the same vaccine needed to maintain immunity if it decreases over time. Updated vaccines protect against new versions of a virus.\n",
            "Section: What’s considered fully vaccinated (up to date) on COVID vaccination?\n",
            "  - In the U.S., recommendations change frequently and depend on your age, previous vaccinations and the manufacturer of the vaccine. Adults and children 5 years and older with healthy immune systems should get one dose of an updated COVID-19 shot to be considered up to date. Kids ages 6 months to 4 years old need multiple doses to be up to date, and at least one of these doses should be the updated COVID-19 shot.\n",
            "  - If you have a compromised immune system, you might need additional doses to be protected. Always double-check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or ask your healthcare provider for current recommendations.\n",
            "Section: Will we need updated COVID vaccines every year?\n",
            "  - Experts aren’t yet sure whether we’ll need new COVID vaccines yearly, similarly to flu shots. In the U.S., the FDA and CDC currently recommend that manufacturers update their vaccines if they’re needed to protect against new variants.\n",
            "Section: How do COVID vaccines work?\n",
            "  - COVID vaccines, like allvaccines, work by training your immune system to fight off harmful germs (pathogens) that attempt to invade your body. But what does that mean? First, we have to understand how your immune system fights off viruses, bacteria and other pathogens.\n",
            "Section: Adaptive immunity\n",
            "  - Each pathogen has a unique part that your body recognizes as an invader, called anantigen. It’s like a distinctive birthmark or tattoo you look for to identify someone. In COVID-19, it’s a protein that sticks out all around the outside of the virus (the spike protein).\n",
            "  - The first time an invader, like a virus or bacteria, enters your body, your immune system needs to look for the right tools (specificB-cells) to recognize the antigen and destroy the pathogen it belongs to. When your immune cells find the right tools, they make a lot of them to find and get rid of the infection. But this process can take some time.\n",
            "  - You also have special cells that remember the pathogen (memory B-cells). Like taking a photo and putting it on a “wanted” poster, your immune cells can then patrol your body, looking for familiar pathogens. If they encounter one, they can destroy it much more quickly than the first time it infected you — often before it makes you sick at all. This is called adaptive immunity.\n",
            "  - COVID vaccines aim to tell your body what SARS-CoV-2 looks like without actually getting an infection. Then your immune system can build up its tools and surveillance team, so when it sees the virus, it can fight it off quickly. For some people, this means they don’t get sick at all if they’re exposed to COVID. Other times, it makes their symptoms less severe and allows them to recover more quickly.\n",
            "Section: What types of COVID vaccines are there?\n",
            "  - There are currently three updated COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. They’re categorized based on the method they use to get your body to recognize the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            "  - mRNA vaccines(Moderna® and Pfizer-BioNTech®).These use the instructions for a part of the virus (mRNA) to train your immune system.\n",
            "  - Protein subunit vaccines (Novavax®).These use a part of the virus to train your immune system.\n",
            "  - Viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen®) are no longer available in the U.S. These used a different, harmless virus and a small part of COVID’s genetic code (DNA) to train your immune system.\n",
            "Section: mRNA vaccines\n",
            "  - mRNA vaccines don’t use a part of the virus to train your immune system. Instead, they give your body instructions that it uses to manufacture harmless proteins that look like parts of the virus (in the case of COVID, the spike protein). Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines. Your body uses the mRNA instructions to make the spike protein for your immune system to recognize.\n",
            "Section: Protein subunit vaccines\n",
            "  - Protein subunit vaccines use a part of the virus to get an immune system response. The Novavax vaccine delivers the spike protein to your cells so they can recognize and be prepared to destroy it if they see it again. Since it’s just part of the virus and not the actual virus itself, it can’t make more copies of itself or hurt you.\n",
            "Section: How should I prepare for a COVID vaccine?\n",
            "  - Before getting your COVID shot, you should:\n",
            "  - Make sure you have an appointment if you need one. Many places that give COVID vaccines in the U.S. require an appointment. You might also need to see if the cost of the shot is covered by your insurance (or federal programs that cover the cost) at that location.\n",
            "  - Bring your vaccination card with you. Make sure you get proof of vaccination if you need it for work, school or travel.\n",
            "  - Avoid taking ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®) to prevent vaccine side effects (it’s okay to take them to treat side effects if they happen). It’s possible these medications could reduce your immune response to the vaccine. Talk to a healthcare provider before getting vaccinated if you regularly take these medications to treat another condition and are concerned about their effects on your immune response. You usually don’t have to stop taking them before getting vaccinated.\n",
            "  - Make sure you have enough time after your appointment to wait for 15 minutes before leaving.\n",
            "Section: What happens when you get your COVID vaccine?\n",
            "  - Healthcare providers give all COVID vaccines as injections (shots). In adults and children over 5, a provider gives you the injection into the muscle of your upper arm. In children under 5, the injection is in their thigh (though 3- and 4-year-olds sometimes get it in their arms).\n",
            "  - A provider will clean the area with an alcohol swab and inject the vaccine with a needle. They’ll put a bandage over it. Sometimes they’ll put a small, round bandage (a pre-injection bandage, or an Inject-Safe™ barrier bandage) on first and inject the needle into your skin through the bandage.\n",
            "  - Your provider may ask you to wait at least 15 minutes before leaving to make sure you don’t have an immediate allergic reaction.\n",
            "Section: How long does the COVID vaccine last?\n",
            "  - Studies suggest COVID vaccines are most effective in the first few months following your shot. That’s why when health experts recommend boosters or updated doses, they’re usually given three to four months after your last COVID shot.\n",
            "Section: How effective are COVID vaccines?\n",
            "  - Studies suggest that people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 are less likely than those who aren’t vaccinated to:\n",
            "  - Get COVID-19.\n",
            "  - Get seriously ill from COVID-19 when they do get sick.\n",
            "  - Have to be hospitalized due to COVID-19.\n",
            "Section: Which COVID vaccine is the safest?\n",
            "  - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Novavax vaccines have all been tested and proven safe. Like every medicine, COVID vaccines go through a series of tests to learn whether they’re safe and effective (clinical trials). Thousands of volunteers receive a vaccine before it’s approved for the public. Vaccine manufacturers didn’t skip any of these tests before the FDA and other public health organizations around the world approved their COVID vaccines.\n",
            "  - A medication that uses the same RNA technology had been tested and approved before COVID vaccines were developed. This made COVID vaccine development faster than vaccines before it.\n",
            "  - No matter which type of shot you get, your body breaks down the ingredients or they’re destroyed by your immune system within a few days. This means vaccines can’t cause long-lasting health effects.\n",
            "  - All that being said, any vaccine or medication has a risk of side effects and allergic reactions, which can sometimes be severe. Serious health conditions as a result of COVID vaccination are very rare.\n",
            "Section: What are the side effects of the COVID vaccine?\n",
            "  - The most common risk of getting a COVID vaccine is experiencing unpleasant but harmless side effects. Side effects of the COVID vaccine include:\n",
            "  - Pain where you got the injection.\n",
            "  - Fatigue.\n",
            "  - Headache.\n",
            "  - Muscle aches.\n",
            "  - Fever.\n",
            "Section: How long do COVID vaccine side effects last?\n",
            "  - Side effects like muscle aches, tiredness and fever usually last a day or two. Your arm might hurt for several days.\n",
            "Section: What are the possible complications of COVID vaccines?\n",
            "  - Serious complications of COVID vaccines are rare. They include:\n",
            "  - Allergic reactions, includinganaphylaxis.\n",
            "  - Inflammation of the lining of your heart (pericarditis) or heart muscle (myocarditis).\n",
            "Section: Allergic reactions\n",
            "  - Some people have an allergic reaction to the ingredients in vaccines. About 1 in 200,000 people who get a COVID shot have anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that causes swelling and extremely low blood pressure. The risk of severe allergic reactions is the reason your provider asks you to wait for 15 minutes after getting your shot — so you can get medical attention right away if you experience an unexpected reaction.\n",
            "  - Symptoms of an allergic reaction include:\n",
            "  - Skin rash.\n",
            "  - Itching.\n",

            "Section: Pericarditis and myocarditis\n",
            "  - Some people have had an inflammation of their heart muscle (myocarditis) or the outer lining of their heart (pericarditis) after getting an mRNA vaccine. Though rare, it’s most common in men and peopleassigned male at birth (AMAB)between the ages of 18 and 29 after getting their second shots.\n",
            "  - Symptoms of pericarditis and myocarditis include:\n",
            "  - Chest pain.\n",
            "  - Shortness of breath.\n",

            "  - You shouldn’t get a COVID vaccine if you:\n",
            "  - Have a known allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine.\n",
            "  - Have ever had an allergic reaction to a COVID vaccine. Ask your healthcare provider if there’s another option for vaccination (like a different brand or type of vaccine).\n",
            "  - Currently have COVID.\n",
            "Section: What happens if you get the COVID vaccine while you’re testing positive?\n",
            "  - If you get your shot while you’re sick with COVID, you could end up making yourself feel sicker. You also risk getting other people sick with COVID by going out to get vaccinated.\n",
            "  - It’s not necessary to get a COVID vaccine if you’ve recently been sick — it won’t help you get better faster, and you’ll get natural immunity from your body fighting it off. COVID immunity lasts several months after an infection, but can decrease over time. If you’re not up to date on your vaccines, you could consider waiting three months after your symptoms started or you tested positive to get vaccinated.\n",
            "Section: When should I call my healthcare provider?\n",
            "  - Go to an emergency room immediately if you have signs of a severe allergic reaction, including trouble breathing, severe hives or swelling of your face, lip, tongue or throat.\n",
            "  - Talk to your healthcare provider if you:\n",
            "  - Have concerns about getting vaccinated for COVID.\n",
            "  - Want to understand how to get you or your child fully vaccinated.\n",
            "  - Aren’t sure which COVID vaccine is right for you.\n",
            "Section: When did the COVID vaccine come out?\n",
            "  - The FDA authorized the first COVID vaccines for emergency use in the U.S. in December of 2020. It might seem like they came out fast. But decades of research went into developing the technology that now makes vaccines faster and easier to develop.\n",
            "  - Research into mRNA technology dates back to the 1970s. Scientists first started applying it to vaccine development in the 1990s. It took over 20 years of research to learn how to get our immune systems to recognize the mRNA without destroying it too quickly, and how to get it into our cells.\n",
            "  - Finally, in 2018, the FDA approvedpatisiran (Onpattro®), a drug that treats a rare nerve disease. The method patisiran uses to deliver RNA (lipid nanoparticles) paved the way for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to use it in their COVID vaccines.\n",
            "Section: Are COVID vaccines free?\n",
            "  - Anyone living in the U.S. can get their COVID vaccine for free. Insurance is required to cover it (check with your insurer for covered locations). If you don’t have insurance, COVID vaccines are still free through the Bridge Access Program through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n",
            "Section: Do COVID vaccines cause blood clots?\n",
            "  - Thrombosiswith thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a condition that can cause blood clots, was an extremely rare complication of certain COVID vaccines that are no longer available. The condition activates your platelets, part of your blood that helps it clot.\n",
            "  - About 1 in 250,000 people had TTS after getting Johnson & Johnson/Janssen or AstraZeneca®vaccines. Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and AstraZeneca COVID vaccines are no longer available, and AstraZeneca vaccines were never used in the U.S. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines aren’t associated with TTS.\n",
            "  - A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
            "  - Scientists were able to develop COVID vaccines in record time thanks to decades of research in mRNA technology. Before the vaccines, millions of people were seriously ill or died of COVID-19. Hospitals were overflowing. Since the FDA authorized the first COVID vaccines in late 2020, over 270 million people (or 81% of the U.S. population) have received at least one dose. This has prevented millions of deaths and hospitalizations. The technology they use is promising for developing future vaccines quickly.\n",

            "Section: What is lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)?\n",
            "  - Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is a surgical procedure that removes parts of your lungs to help them work more effectively. LVRS takes out parts of your lungs that are damaged and trapping air. Sometimes, providers place valves that allow trapped air to get out instead (bronchoscopic lung volume reduction).\n",
            "  - Either type of lung reduction reduces the size of your lungs and allows air to reach healthy parts of your lungs. This means more oxygen from the air can get into your bloodstream and to your tissues.\n",
            "  - Providers recommend lung volume reduction surgery to relieve symptoms in certain people with severeemphysema, a type ofchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that can trap air in pockets in your lungs.\n",
            "  - Providers only recommend LVRS after you’vequit smoking, and medications andpulmonary rehabilitationaren’t relieving your symptoms. It isn’t a cure for COPD and won’t extend your life. The goal is to help you feel better and improve your quality of life.\n",
            "Section: Who qualifies for lung volume reduction?\n",
            "  - Studies suggest only certain people benefit from LVRS. You might be eligible if you:\n",
            "  - Are younger than 75.\n",
            "  - Have severeshortness of breath (dyspnea), even with medications and pulmonary rehabilitation.\n",
            "  - The upper area of your lungs (apex) is affected the most, with less damage in other areas of your lungs.\n",
            "  - Your lungs are overinflated and have evidence of severe air trapping.\n",
            "  - Don’t currently smoke and haven’t smoked in four months or longer.\n",
            "  - Are able to complete six to 10 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation before surgery and 10 to 12 sessions after surgery.\n",
            "Section: What’s the difference between open surgery and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction?\n",
            "  - To reduce lung volume, a provider can remove the damaged parts of your lung through cuts (incisions) in your chest using athoracoscopyor asternotomy(open surgery). Or they can use special valves that allow air to escape but not get trapped (bronchoscopic LVRS). Your surgeon will carefully evaluate your specific situation to determine the best approach.\n",
            "Section: Thoracoscopy and sternotomy\n",
            "  - If a provider is going to remove damaged parts of your lungs, they’ll use one of two techniques:\n",
            "  - Thoracoscopy. A surgeon makes three to five small cuts on both sides of your chest, between your ribs. A thoracoscopy is usually done asvideo-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Your provider will insert a videoscope through one of the incisions to allow them to see your lungs. A thoracoscopy is less invasive than a sternotomy.\n",
            "  - Sternotomy. During a median sternotomy, a surgeon cuts through your breastbone to open your chest. A surgeon can access both lungs through the same incision with this approach. Recovery from a sternotomy is usually less painful than recovery from thoracoscopy.\n",
            "Section: Bronchoscopic (endoscopic) lung volume reduction surgery\n",
            "  - Bronchoscopyis the least invasive method of lung volume reduction. It doesn’t require any incisions. A surgeon will place a thin tube with a light on it (bronchoscope) down your throat and into your airways. They use the bronchoscope to place valves in areas of your lung that are overinflated.\n",
            "  - The valves allow air to escape when you breathe out, but they don’t let air in when you breathe in. Over time, this reduces the amount of air trapped in your lungs. This is also called endobronchial valve (EBV) therapy.\n",
            "Section: Which tests will I have before lung volume reduction surgery?\n",
            "  - You may need a number of tests to determine if you’re a good candidate for LVRS based on your symptoms and characteristics of the disease. These include:\n",
            "  - Imaging.Chest x-raysand high-resolutionCT scans(computed tomography scans) can help your provider know if a large amount of air is trapped in your lungs, and where the worst damage is.\n",
            "  - Pulmonary function tests.LVRS might be more likely to help people with an FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of less than 45% onspirometry tests.\n",
            "  - Exercise tests.Ametabolic exercise stress test(cardiopulmonary exercise test) and six-minute walk test can help your provider understand the level of exercise you can tolerate.\n",
            "  - Lung diffusion test.Your provider may want you to have a DLCO (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) that’s above 20% of the predicted value.\n",
            "  - Cardiac (heart) tests.Anelectrocardiogram (EKG),an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) and astress testcan help your provider understand how well your heart is working.\n",
            "  - Ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan)andarterial blood gas tests.These tests can give your provider additional information about how well your respiratory system is working.\n",
            "Section: What happens before LVRS?\n",

You may worry that you’ll spread radiation to other people, particularly small children or pregnant people. They may be around you as much as they like, but you should limit the amount of time that they sit in your lap. In general, it’s a good idea not to have a small child or pregnant person sit on your lap for more than 20 minutes at a time for two months after your procedure. But everyone’s situation is different. Ask your radiation oncologist for guidance.\n",
            "  - Radiation proctitis: This condition is an uncommon complication. It affects less than 3% of people who have radiation in their pelvic area, including the prostate. Radiation proctitis causes bleeding and inflammation in your rectum after radiation therapy.\n",

            "  - In brachytherapy for prostate cancer, radiation oncologists target tumors with tiny amounts of radioactive material that’s implanted or placed close to the tumor in your prostate. The implant is permanent, meaning it stays in your prostate. Prostate cancer brachytherapy is a common treatment for cancer that hasn’t spread to other parts of your body. The treatment is safe and effective, but you’ll likely have many questions about it. Your radiation oncology team will be glad to explain the treatment and why it may be a treatment option for you.\n",

            "  - Anterior glottal web formation (Wendler glottoplasty): Removes several layers of tissue from the vocal cords at the front of your voice box. Your laryngologist uses stitches to join the vocal cords in this area, shortening the overall length of your voice box. This is the most common type of voice feminization surgery.\n",
            "  - Laser reduction glottoplasty (LRG): Destroys the outermost tissues of your vocal cords with light energy from a laser, increasing the tension in your vocal cords. It’s a type of laser-assisted voice adjustment (LAVA).\n",
            "  - Cricothyroid approximation (CTA): Stitches togethercartilagefrom the top and bottom of your voice box, increasing the tightness of your vocal cords. This was the first procedure for voice feminization surgery. Laryngologists use it less and less because studies show its effects aren’t as long-lasting as other types of surgery.\n",
            "  - Feminization laryngoplasty: Removes cartilage from yourthyroid(a gland in your neck) and parts of your vocal cords. Surgery lifts your voice box and shortens your vocal cords. Your laryngologist may perform a single procedure or a combination of them to raise your pitch.\n",
            "Section: How long does surgery take?\n",

            "  - Your laryngologist and SLP care team will follow you closely after your procedure. Depending on the procedure you choose with your care team, you may have additional minor procedures to get the best results. You’ll likely need a period of voice rest (no speaking) immediately after the surgery for five to 14 days. You may also need to do additional SLP therapy to maximize the effect of the procedure.\n",
            "  - Voice feminization surgery is usually outpatient. This means you’ll likely get to go home the same day as your procedure.\n",
            "Section: What are the benefits of voice feminization surgery?\n",
            "  - The major benefit of voice feminization surgery is that you can achieve a pitch that more closely matches your gender identity. Many people who have the procedure consider it an important part of transitioning.\n",
            "  - Unlike voice therapy alone, surgery can:\n",
            "  - Help you maintain your pitch more consistently. It’s less likely your voice will drop when you’re making an involuntary sound, like coughing or clearing your throat. You can rely on your pitch remaining constant when your voice tires. Additionally, surgery requires no conscious effort on your part to maintain these effects.\n",
            "  - Prevent you from getting misgendered based on pitch alone. It’s less likely you’ll get misgendered in situations where people assume gender based only on how high or low your voice is, like over the phone.\n",
            "Section: How successful is this surgery?\n",
            "  - Voice feminization surgery can successfully raise your pitch. Of the different procedures, anterior glottal web formation raises pitch the most. The final results will depend on how high or low your pitch is before surgery.\n",
            "  - Still, success depends on your treatment goals. How high or low someone’s voice is only accounts for about 40% of how we perceive gender based on speech and communication. The other 60% comes from things you learn in voice therapy, like loudness, resonance, pitch variation and nonverbal cues.\n",
            "  - This is why it’s so important to talk with your laryngologist and SLP before surgery so everyone’s on the same page about what a successful voice transition means for you.\n",

            "  - Most people who get voice feminization surgery have tried voice therapy but haven’t felt completely satisfied with increases in pitch. But surgery is a big step. Even if you know your voice should sound higher to feel more like you, you may still wonder,“Is it worth it?”The short answer may feel frustrating: It depends on you and your goals.\n",
            "  - Making sure you and your care team are aligned on your transition goals is the best thing you can do to ensure you get the voice care you deserve. This is why it’s such a good idea to work with a laryngologist who specializes in gender affirmation care. They can help you understand what results to expect from surgery and which changes will require working with a speech-language pathologist (SLP). The care team you assemble makes all the difference when it comes to what counts as a successful surgery.\n",

            "Section: What is an antibody (serology) test?\n",
            "  - An antibody test looks for antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins your body makes to fight infection. Your immune system creates unique antibodies to respond to different unknown substances such as viruses, bacteria and allergens (tiny particles that cause allergies). Providers also call this test a serology test.\n",
            "  - Healthcare providers use antibody tests to tell if you’ve had an infection or if you’ve been exposed to a specific virus. A more recent example of this is the antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causesCOVID-19). If you test positive for COVID-19 antibodies, that means you’ve been exposed to that virus and your body created antibodies to fight it. Your immune system also develops COVID-19 antibodies after you receive theCOVID-19 vaccine.\n",
            "  - After a vaccination, infection, or exposure to infectious agents, it can take up to several weeks for yourimmune systemto make antibodies. Antibody tests are not the same as diagnostic tests that check for an active (current) infection. These tests do not detect the infectious agent itself. They evaluate your body’s response to the virus.\n",
            "Section: When would an antibody test be needed?\n",
            "  - You may need a COVID-19 antibody test if you:\n",
            "  - Had symptoms of COVID-19 but didn’t get tested while you were sick.\n",
            "  - Had symptoms but tested negative for the virus. In this case, your provider may use an antibody test about a week or two after you recover to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19.\n",
            "  - Have lasting COVID-19 symptoms or complications of COVID-19 after an infection (long COVID or long-hauler COVID-19). These complications include multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n",
            "  - In addition to COVID-19, healthcare providers use antibody blood tests to check for a wide range of diseases and disorders. These tests help providers diagnose disease by detecting antibodies to specific viruses and bacteria. Your provider uses antibody tests to look for:\n",
            "  - Autoimmune disorders such asCeliac diseaseandlupus.\n",
            "  - Bacterial infections, includingLyme disease,pertussis (whooping cough)and tetanus.\n",
            "  - Cancer, includingmultiple myeloma.\n",
            "  - Viruses, includingHIV,chickenpox(varicella-zoster virus),mononucleosis(which results from the Epstein-Barr virus) andWest Nile virus.\n",
            "  - Providers also use antibody tests to evaluate you or your child for allergies. The tests can tell if your immune system created antibodies in response to various allergens. Providers call the response anallergic reaction. But some of these tests (especially antibody tests forfood allergies) can produce a false-positive result. That means the results might be positive for antibodies, but you may not actually be allergic.\n",
            "Section: Who performs an antibody blood test?\n",
            "  - A healthcare provider performs this test. You get the test at your doctor’s office, a laboratory or a special clinic.\n",
            "Section: What are the types of antibody tests?\n",
            "  - Different serology tests detect different antibodies. Your body creates five main types of antibodies:\n",
            "  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA).\n",
            "  - Immunoglobulin D (IgD).\n",
            "  - Immunoglobulin E (IgE).\n",
            "  - Immunoglobulin G (IgG).\n",
            "  - Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n",
            "  - Consider the COVID-19 antibody test as an example of how the process works:\n",
            "  - Most COVID-19 antibody tests look for IgM and IgG antibodies. Your body usually produces IgM antibodies first, as soon as you’re exposed to a virus like SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies fade away sooner than others and may not be detectable for very long.\n",
            "  - IgG and IgA antibodies usually appear about a week to 10 days after you were exposed to the virus. Since IgG antibodies stay in your body longer, an antibody test may detect these antibodies for months or even years after a COVID-19 infection.\n",
            "Section: If I got a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for antibodies?\n",
            "  - COVID-19 vaccines (such as the mRNA vaccine) teach your body how to create antibodies that fight the virus. So, you might test positive for COVID-19 antibodies if you get an antibody test after your vaccine. But your results will depend on several factors, including when you get the test and what type of antibody test you get. Different antibody tests check for different types of antibodies.\n",
            "Section: How does the antibody test work?\n",
            "  - Your provider takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab. The lab tests your blood for antibodies. It also measures the levels of specific types of antibodies.\n",
            "Section: How do I prepare for the antibody test?\n",
            "  - There aren’t any special preparations needed for this type of test. You may want to wear a short-sleeved shirt to make it easier for your provider to access a vein in your arm.\n",
            "Section: What to expect during the antibody test?\n",
            "  - Your provider cleans the skin on your arm. They insert a needle into a vein. You will feel a pinch when the needle goes in, but it usually doesn’t hurt. Your provider removes a sample of your blood through the needle and collects it in a tube. Then they place a bandage on your arm.\n",
            "  - Instead of using your arm, your provider may prick the tip of your finger to draw blood. Your provider will tell you if it’s best to use your arm or your finger for the blood draw.\n",
            "Section: What to expect after the antibody test?\n",
            "  - Your arm may be a little sore for a few hours after the test. You’ll have a piece of gauze and a bandage on your arm, which you can remove after a few hours. A littlebruisemay appear where your provider inserted the needle.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks of this test?\n",
            "  - Blood tests are common and safe. Some people may feel a little lightheaded or dizzy afterward. If you have a history ofdizzinessafter blood tests, tell your provider.\n",
            "Section: When should I know the results of the antibody test?\n",
            "  - You may get your results the same day. Or, your provider might send your blood sample away to a lab, so results might not be ready for a few days. Ask your provider when you can expect results.\n",
            "Section: What do the results of my antibody test mean?\n",
            "  - A positive test result means there are antibodies in your blood, which can include COVID-19 antibodies. In the case of a COVID-19 antibody test, the antibodies could be the result of your body’s response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Or the presence of antibodies could mean you were exposed to COVID-19 in the past and your body developed antibodies to fight the virus.\n",
            "  - Typically, the more severe the infection, the higher the level of antibodies. But even people who had mild symptoms (or no symptoms at all) can test positive for antibodies.\n",
            "  - Antibodies can protect you from getting infected by the same germ in the future. But the length of time that protection lasts depends on several factors, including the type of virus or bacteria. That’s why providers don’t use antibody tests to check for immunity to COVID-19.\n",
            "  - A negative test result could mean:\n",
            "  - You’ve never had the COVID-19 infection or haven’t been exposed to COVID-19.\n",
            "  - You had COVID-19 (or you were exposed to it), but your immune system didn’t create enough antibodies to show up on a test.\n",
            "  - You had COVID-19, but your antibodies didn’t last long enough to show up on a test — or you were tested too late.\n",
            "Section: When should I call my doctor?\n",
            "  - Talk to your provider if you have questions about your test results. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 or continue to have symptoms from the infection after a couple of weeks, call your provider right away.\n",
            "  - A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
            "  - Antibody tests help your provider confirm a diagnosis of a wide range of allergies and diseases, including COVID-19. They also help your provider evaluate your immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria after you’ve been exposed to them. If you have questions about the results of your antibody test, call your provider. In some cases, you may need a second antibody test to confirm your results. See your provider right away if you develop symptoms of COVID-19 or if you continue to have symptoms after the infection.\n",

            "  - A C3 complement blood test measures the levels of a specific type of protein in your blood (C3 proteins). As part of your immune system, C3 proteins destroy microbes (germs) that can make you sick. Sometimes, C3 proteins launch an attack against healthy cells by mistake.\n",
            "  - The results of this blood test give your healthcare provider information about how your immune system is working. By measuring the amount of C3 proteins, your healthcare provider can diagnose infection, disease, immune deficiency and other health conditions, like autoimmune disorders. This test also helps your healthcare provider monitor treatment for autoimmune disease.\n",
            "Section: What is the complement system?\n",
            "  - C3 proteins are part of the complement system, which is part of yourimmune system. The complement system includes more than 30 different proteins. They work together in a sequence to protect you from infection and illness.\n",
            "  - When your immune system identifies a harmful substance or recognizes signs of an infection, it activates a protein in the complement system to launch an attack. That protein activates another protein, which activates another and another. Healthcare providers call this process a complement cascade. The proteins, like C3, are consumed in this process.\n",

            "  - An HIV test shows whether you have thehuman immunodeficiency virus(HIV). HIV is asexually transmitted infection(STI) that attacks your immune system, making it harder for your body to fight infections. In some — but not all —cases, HIV can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can be life-threatening.\n",
            "  - Getting tested for HIV is important because the sooner you know about an infection, the sooner you can receive treatment. Current treatments for HIV can strengthen your immune system to fend off the virus more effectively. Early treatment can prevent you from developing AIDS.\n",

            "Section: What are the three tests for HIV?\n",
            "  - To diagnose HIV, your healthcare provider can order any of three types of tests. Depending on the test, you’ll provide a blood sample (from a vein or a finger prick) or an oral fluid sample that can be tested for HIV. Oral fluid contains cells from your mouth. It’s different from saliva.\n",
            "  - Nucleic acid (NAT) test:The NAT test can detect HIV RNA, the genetic material in HIV. The test can also tell how much of the virus is in your blood (viral load). The NAT is a thorough lab test requiring a blood draw (a healthcare provider draws blood from a vein). It can be expensive.\n",
            "  - Antigen/antibody test:Combination antigen/antibody tests check for signs of the virus instead of the virus itself, as with the NAT test. First, it tests for antigens. An antigen is a substance that activates your immune system to fight HIV. If you have HIV, antigen p24 will be in your blood. The test also checks for HIV antibodies. Your immune system makes HIV antibodies to fight off the virus. Antigens show up in your blood before antibodies do.\n",
            "  - Antibody tests:This test checks for HIV antibodies.\n",
            "  - Since a NAT test is more expensive, you’ll rarely take this test to screen for HIV unless you have symptoms. If you’re HIV-positive, your healthcare provider may order a NAT test to check your viral load, or how much of the virus is in your blood.\n",
            "  - To screen for HIV, you’ll likely take an antibody test or a combination antigen/antibody test first. You’ll need follow-up testing if your results are positive to confirm the results.\n",

            "Section: HIV testing for high-risk groups\n",
            "  - HIV gets transmitted through body fluids exchanged during sex and through blood. You’re considered high-risk if it’s likely that you’ve been exposed to these fluids from a person who has HIV. Having unprotected sex (without acondomor dental dam) with an HIV-positive partner greatly increases your risk of HIV.\n",
            "  - You may need regular HIV tests if:\n",
            "  - You have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an HIV-positive partner or a partner whose HIV status you don’t know.\n",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that men who have sex with men get tested every three to six months. Ask your healthcare provider about how often you should get tested.\n",
            "  - You should also get tested if you’re sexually assaulted. In these instances, contact a healthcare provider to get started on HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is a series of medicines that can prevent HIV. You have to begin taking them within 72 hours of a possible exposure for them to work.\n",

            "Section: How does an HIV test work?\n",
            "  - An HIV test looks for evidence of HIV in your blood or oral fluid. This evidence may be the virus itself, HIV antigens and antibodies, or just the antibodies. Additional testing will be needed to confirm the results if you test positive. If you test negative, this means that you likely don’t have the virus. To trust the results, you’ll need to be sure that you took the test at the right time to detect the virus. It takes some time after you’ve been exposed to the virus for an HIV test to detect it.\n",
            "Section: How soon after exposure to HIV can a test detect the virus?\n",
            "  - HIV tests can’t detect HIV immediately after you’ve been exposed. It takes time for your body to make antibodies in response to the virus. The window period is the time gap between when you were exposed and when a test can detect the virus. You’ll want to get tested after the window period. The window period varies from person to person and by the type of test.\n",
            "  - A nucleic acid (NAT) testhas the shortest window period.It can tell if you have an HIV infection from 10 to 33 days after exposure.\n",
            "  - Antigen/Antibody testscan detect infection from 18 to 45 days after exposure (for blood draw tests) or 18 to 90 days after exposure (for finger-prick tests).\n",
            "  - Antibody tests(most rapid and at-home tests) can detect infection 23 to 90 days after exposure.\n",
            "  - If the test is negative and you feel you’ve been exposed, get retested.\n",
            "Section: How do I prepare for an HIV test?\n",
            "  - You don't need to do anything to prepare for tests involving blood draws. For at-home tests that involve collecting oral fluid, you may need to avoid eating or drinking 30 minutes before taking the test. Follow the instructions on the kit.\n",
            "Section: What should I expect during the HIV test?\n",

            "Section: Lab HIV tests\n",
            "  - Most HIV tests involve a healthcare professional drawing blood and sending it to a lab for analysis. These tests may take place in your provider’s office or a clinic. If you test positive, your provider will do additional testing to confirm the results. The CDC recommends the following sequence of HIV tests:\n",
            "  - Test #1: Anantigen/antibody testto check for HIV antigen p24 and HIV antibodies. You’ll need a second test to confirm the results if you test positive.\n",
            "  - Test #2: Anantibody testto check for antibodies associated with the two types of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2. A second positive result will confirm that you’re HIV-positive. If the results are inconclusive, you’ll need to take a third test.\n",
            "  - Test #3: ANAT testto check for HIV in your blood.\n",

            "Section: Rapid HIV tests\n",
            "  - Rapid tests check your blood or oral fluid for HIV antibodies. There is also a rapid HIV antigen/antibody test. A healthcare professional may collect blood using a blood draw from a vein or a finger prick. An oral fluid sample will require a mouth swab.\n",
            "  - Some rapid tests can provide results in as little as five minutes. Keep in mind that these results are preliminary. If your result is positive, you’ll need to follow up with your healthcare provider to take an additional test before you’ll know your HIV status.\n",
            "Section: At-home HIV tests\n",
            "  - The only FDA-approved at-home test is OraQuick®, a rapid HIV test that checks for HIV antibodies. To use it, you swab your upper and lower gums to collect a sample of oral fluid. You place the swab in a vial that shows a positive or negative result (similar to a pregnancy test). You can view results within 20 to 40 minutes.\n",
            "  - If the results are positive, you’ll need additional testing to confirm the results.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks of this test?\n",

            "Section: When should I know the results of the test?\n",
            "  - How quickly you receive the results depends on the type of test. Some rapid tests, such as antigen/antibody and antibody tests, can produce results in under 20 minutes. The NAT test has the shortest window period for detecting HIV after an exposure. Still, it requires more waiting to get the results. You may have to wait several days to get results from the NAT test.\n",
            "Section: What type of results do you get, and what do the results mean?\n",
            "  - Test results will be negative or positive.\n",
            "  - Anegative resultmeans that the test didn’t detect signs of the virus. These results may mean that you don’t have HIV or that it’s too soon since your HIV exposure for the test to detect the virus.\n",
            "  - Apositive resultmeans that the test did detect signs of the virus. These results may mean that you have HIV or that you’ll need additional testing to confirm results.\n",
            "Section: What should I do if my results are negative?\n",
            "  - If your first test is negative and there’s a chance that you took the test too soon to detect HIV exposure, take a second test after the window period has passed. The second test can confirm your negative result if you got tested before the infection was active in your body.\n",
            "  - Even with a negative result, it’s important to protect yourself in the future. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is right for you. The PrEP daily pill can reduce your risk of getting HIV from sexual contact by 99%. For people who use IV drugs, it lowers the risk by 74%. Taking PrEP as prescribed is essential if you’re HIV-negative and your partner is HIV-positive.\n",
            "  - Even if you take PrEP, it’s recommended that you use a condom or dental dam to reduce your risk of contracting HIV and other STIs.\n",

            "  - If you get a positive result on one test, you’ll want to do additional testing with your healthcare provider to be sure. Once your diagnosis is confirmed, you’ll want to work with your provider on a treatment plan. Your healthcare provider will determine how far HIV has progressed and recommend medicines to help you manage it. Treatment for HIV, or antiretroviral therapy, can help your body fight the virus and prevent AIDS. Researchers are producing highly active drugs against the virus. If used consistently and correctly, they can prevent disease progression and enable you to live a healthy life.\n",
            "  - You’ll also want to talk about your diagnosis with your sexual partner. If you and your partner have had unprotected sex, you could have transmitted the virus to them. They should get tested, too.\n",
            "Section: When should I take an HIV test?\n",
            "  - You should take an HIV test at least once in your life — and even more if you’re at high risk of exposure. Be sure to take the test after the window period, when you can trust that the test can detect the virus.\n",
            "Section: Can a normal blood test detect HIV?\n",
            "  - HIV blood tests involve simple blood draws that are the same as most blood tests. What makes an HIV test different is how your blood gets tested once it’s sent to the lab. Your blood will need to be tested specifically for signs of HIV, including antigens, antibodies or HIV RNA.\n",
            "Section: What is a normal HIV test result?\n",

            "Section: What happens after an MRCP?\n",
            "  - You can go home after your vital signs look good and the sedative (if you received one) wears off. Side effects from the dye or procedure are rare. You should alert your care team if you feelnauseated, have aheadacheor feel like you’re having an allergic reaction. Someone should drive you home after the test. You can resume your usual activities and diet.\n",
            "Section: What are the benefits of an MRCP?\n",
            "  - This specialized contrast MRI produces clear, detailed images of organs and ducts without the use ofX-rayradiation. MRCP uses an MRI scanner, which creates an extremely powerful magnetic field and uses radiofrequency waves and computer processing to create images. The radiofrequency waves for an MRI are similar to those used for FM radio broadcasts you can listen to in your car. That means there’s no radiation exposure.\n",
            "Section: What are the risks of an MRCP?\n",
            "  - An MRCP is a relatively safe procedure. Potential risks include:\n",
            "  - Allergic reaction:It’s rare for someone to experience anallergic reactionlikeanaphylaxisto the IV contrast agent or dye during an MRCP. The dye uses an element called gadolinium instead of iodine since iodine is more likely to cause a reaction.\n",
            "  - Claustrophobia:Lying in an enclosed space like an MRI scanner can be difficult — if not impossible — if you haveclaustrophobia(fear of enclosed spaces). About 1 in 8 people have claustrophobia, making it one of the more common phobias. Healthcare providers who perform MRCP tests are very familiar with this phobia and can give you a sedative to help you relax during the test.\n",
            "  - After an MRCP, yourkidneysfilter out the contrast dye. But studies suggest that small amounts of the metal may stay in your body for months or years. Most people don’t have any side effects because of it, but people with kidney problems (kidney diseaseorkidney failure) may not be able to undergo MRCP. You also shouldn’t get an MRCP if you’re pregnant or plan on becomingpregnantwithin a year.\n",
            "Section: When should I get the test results?\n",
            "  - Your radiologist will read the imaging scans and send the results to your referring healthcare provider. It may take up to a week or two for your provider to get the test results. They’ll review the results with you. Depending on the findings, you may need surgery or a different treatment.\n",
            "Section: When should I call my healthcare provider?\n",
            "  - You should contact your healthcare provider if you develop hives or other signs of an allergic reaction when you get home. You should also let them know if symptoms like abdominal pain worsen.\n",

            "  - A distended abdomen is measurably swollen beyond its normal size. It’s often accompanied by thefeeling of being bloatedwith trapped gas or digestive contents. However, abdominal distension isn’t always from digestive processes. Healthcare providers diagnose a distended abdomen in terms of the “five ‘f’s”: flatus (gas), fetus (pregnancy), feces (trapped poop), fluid (from several causes) or fat.\n",
            "  - A distended abdomen may be very uncomfortable, or it may simply be a symptom that you and your healthcare provider observe visually. It may be acute — a sudden, unusual occurrence — or chronic — something that occurs and resolves itself repeatedly in a predictable way. Chronic abdominal distension accompanied by an uncomfortable bloated feeling is often related to a digestive problem.\n",
            "Section: What does abdominal distension indicate?\n",

            "  - A disorder of the muscle contractions involved in digestion (intestinal pseudo-obstruction), causing digestive contents to back up.\n",
            "  - Abdominal muscle weakness, which causes the abdominal contents to sag outwards and downwards (enteroptosis).\n",
            "Section: How do healthcare providers treat abdominal distension?\n",
            "  - If you seek medical care for your distended abdomen, your healthcare provider will work to isolate the cause. They’ll start by asking you questions about your symptoms and examining your abdomen to see where it's distended. The location of the outward curve, whether it's uniform across your abdominal cavity or more pronounced in a particular region, helps them determine which organs are involved and narrow down the list of likely causes. They may also feel the area with their hands or tap it and listen to the sound it makes to determine the presence of fluids, gasses or solids.\n",
            "  - The internal organs of the abdomen can be classified as either solid or hollow. Solid organs include theliver,spleen,kidneys, adrenals,pancreas, ovaries and uterus. These can become enlarged due to inflammation or growths such as a tumor, abscess or cyst. Your healthcare provider might be able to feel that they are enlarged, or they might need to look at an image of the internal organs to tell. A large growth might be palpable through the skin. Your healthcare provider will confirm your condition with imaging tests, then follow up with additional testing and treatment depending on the condition.\n",
            "  - The hollow organs of the abdomen include thestomach,small intestine, colon,gallbladder, bile ducts, fallopian tubes, uterus and bladder. These organs are only palpable if they are distended. If your healthcare provider can feel any of them, they’ll know immediately where the problem is. Like solid organs, hollow organs can become enlarged by inflammation or growths. But they can also become swollen with the products of digestion —gas, digestive juices, poop and urine — or with pregnancy, in the case of the uterus — or, rarely, with internal bleeding. Imaging tests will clarify this.\n",
            "  - Another cause of abdominal distension is fluid build-up in the lining of the abdominal cavity, called the peritoneum. These tissues can become inflamed from infection (peritonitis), or they can be filled with fluid as a result of a condition called ascites. Usually a side-effect of liver scarring (cirrhosis), ascites occurs when pressure on the blood vessels in the liver (portal hypertension) forces fluid into the abdominal cavity. Healthcare providers can often identify fluid in the peritoneum from a physical exam, but anabdominal ultrasoundis more sensitive.\n",
            "Section: How do you fix a distended abdomen?\n",
            "  - If your distended abdomen has an organic cause, the treatment will be very specific to that cause. It might mean managing a disease, infection, growth, obstruction, or injury. An acute case will resolve when the underlying cause has been treated. A chronic case may be treated supplementally with diuretics (for fluid), laxatives (for constipation) or activated charcoal capsules (for gas).\n",
            "  - If you have functional abdominal distension and the cause is unknown, it might take some trial and error to manage it. Your healthcare provider may recommend ahydrogen breath testto help determine the cause of excess intestinal gas. They might also recommend you try dietary changes,probioticsorenzymesto improve digestive processes. If they suspect muscle weakness as a cause, they might suggest abdominal or pelvic floor exercises.\n",
            "Section: What can I do at home to prevent abdominal distension?\n",
            "  - Prevention is easier if you know the cause. If you notice that abdominal distension occurs after you eat, you may be able to change your eating habits to prevent it. For example:\n",
            "  - Identify food sensitivities and change your diet accordingly.\n",
            "  - Eat smaller amounts more slowly. Wait longer between meals.\n",
            "  - Drink more water and eat more fiber to prevent the accumulation of waste.\n",

            "Section: What is hemostasis?\n",
            "  - Hemostasis is your body’s normal reaction to an injury that causes bleeding. This reaction stops bleeding and allows your body to start repairs on the injury. This capability is essential to keep you alive, particularly with significant injuries. However, in uncommon cases, the processes that control hemostasis can malfunction, causing potentially serious — or even dangerous — problems with bleeding or clotting.\n",
            "Section: How does hemostasis work?\n",
            "  - Hemostasis combines the terms “hemo” (meaning “blood”) and “stasis” (meaning “standing still”). In this context, it’s the term for how your body stops bleeding. Rather than being just a single process, hemostasis is actually a collection of several processes. Though they look like separate processes, these all happen at the same time when your body forms a blood clot.\n",
            "Section: Primary hemostasis (platelet clotting)\n",
            "  - Primary hemostasis is when your body forms a temporary plug to seal an injury. To accomplish that, platelets that circulate in your blood stick to the damaged tissue and activate. That activation means they can “recruit” more platelets to form a platelet “plug” to stop blood loss from the damaged area. That clot works much like a cork or bottle stopper, keeping blood in and debris or germs out. Primary hemostasis may also involve constriction (narrowing) of the damaged blood vessel, which can happen because of substances that activated platelets release.\n",
            "Section: Secondary hemostasis (coagulation cascade)\n",
            "  - The platelet plug is the first step to stop bleeding, but it isn’t stable enough to stay in place without help. The next step, which stabilizes the plug, is secondary hemostasis. This step, sometimes called coagulation, involves molecules in your blood called “coagulation factors.” Those factors activate in sequence, the “coagulation cascade,” which amplifies clotting effects as the sequence continues. Ultimately, the coagulation cascade forms a substance called fibrin. During this step, the platelet plug acts like bricks and the fibrin acts like mortar. Together, they form a solid, stable clot.\n",
            "Section: Fibrin clot remodeling\n",
            "  - The last stage of hemostasis is when your body remodels the existing clot into a fibrin clot. Your body does that because blood clots are a temporary patch, not a permanent solution. That removal involves a process called fibrinolysis. During fibrinolysis, your body remodels the clot into the same kind of tissue that was there before the injury.\n",
            "Section: What causes hemostasis?\n",
            "  - Your body naturally monitors itself for injuries, and when it detects one, it reacts quickly to take control of the situation. Without normal hemostasis, even minor injuries could cause dangerous blood loss. An example of this is hemophilia, a condition where hemostasis doesn't work properly and blood can't clot effectively. Any break in your skin is also a risk for germs to enter your body. Clots help reduce that risk by sealing the injury.\n",
            "Section: What potential health problems can happen with hemostasis?\n",
            "  - Hemostasis refers to normal blood clotting in response to an injury. However, your body can also have too much clotting, known as hypercoagulability. That can cause many blood clots to form spontaneously and block normal blood flow. When blood clots form inside your blood vessels, this is known as thrombosis. When you have thrombosis that happens repeatedly, that’s a condition called thrombophilia.\n",
            "Section: Thrombophilia (hypercoagulability or too much clotting)\n",
            "  - Hypercoagulabilityis when your blood clots too much or too easily. This is dangerous because those clots can develop or get stuck in different places in your body and cause severe, life-threatening problems. Examples of these problems include:\n",
            "  - Stroke.\n",
            "  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can then cause apulmonary embolism.\n",
            "  - Heart attack.\n",
            "  - Many types of cancer can cause hypercoagulability, and some rare conditions that cause hypercoagulability are also genetic. That means they are either inherited from your parents or happen because of a random mutation in your DNA. People with these conditions have thrombophilia. A few examples of conditions like this include:\n",
            "  - Protein C deficiency.\n",
            "  - Prothrombin gene mutation.\n",
            "  - Factor 5 Leidenmutation.\n",

            "  - Severe reactions to infections, such assepsis.\n",

            "Section: Hypocoagulability (not enough clotting)\n",
            "  - When your blood doesn’t clot well, any injury becomes a much more dangerous event. Without proper clotting, even minor injuries can cause you to lose a lot of blood. It also means you’re at greater risk for injuries to organs and blood vessels inside your body, which can then cause internal bleeding.\n",
            "  - Certain types of cancer like leukemia can cause you to bleed too easily. That’s because they often involve a lack of platelets in your body or anti-clotting activity. Conditions that keep your blood from clotting are often genetic, also. Some examples of genetic conditions include:\n",

            "  - Hemostasis is a natural part of your daily life. It helps your body protect itself from bleeding and infection, and recover from injuries big and small. Understanding how it works can help you better care for yourself. It also means you can recognize potential problems with your body’s natural recovery abilities and get help sooner rather than later.\n",

            "Section: What is palinopsia?\n",
            "  - Palinopsia is where you continue seeing something in your field of vision even after it’s no longer there or see it doing something it isn’t still doing. The name “palinopsia” comes from ancient Greek and means “seeing again.” The lingering image appears in your vision spontaneously, well after what you saw is gone, or it might affect and distort what you’re seeing right now.\n",
            "  - While palinopsia affects what you see, it isn’t happening because of your eyes. It happens because of disruptions or unusual activity in areas of your brain that process what your eyes see. The area most often affected is the occipital lobe at the back of your head, where most vision processing happens, but it can also affect other areas that play a role in vision. Palinopsia can — in very rare cases — be a symptom of astroke.\n",
            "Section: Are there different types of palinopsia?\n",
            "  - Experts group palinopsia into two main categories: hallucinatory and illusory. Each contains four possible symptom forms:\n",
            "  - Hallucinatory: This is when areas of your brain that involve visual memory are too active or fire too easily. It usually causes reappearance of something you’ve seen in the past. What you see could come from something you saw just minutes ago, or it could be from years ago. It varies from person to person.\n",
            "  - Illusory: This is when the visual pathways in your brain don’t work like they should. It usually involves changes in how you perceive something you’re seeing at the moment (like a “comet tail” effect on something moving in your field of vision).\n",
            "  - The hallucinatory symptom forms of palinopsia include the following:\n",
            "  - Formed image perseveration. This is a single object that isn’t moving and remains in your field of view. It’s clear and vivid enough that some people try to touch the formed image. It usually lasts only seconds but can last hours or days in unusual cases.\n",
            "  - Scene perseveration. This is like formed image perseveration but with a wider perspective. It can involve objects or people that move. It’s usually a brief, ordinary action like someone touching their face. It can appear over and over several times. And some people with a visual field defect (like a blank spot or gap in their vision) might see the scene in or overlaid on the area of the defect.\n",
            "  - Categorical incorporation. This is when you see an item or a physical characteristic (like facial hair) repeatedly. They’ll usually appear in the same place that matches the context, like seeing the same facial hair on multiple people.\n",
            "  - Pattern visual spread. This is where a pattern or something similar spreads from one object to surrounding ones. An example would be seeing a houndstooth pattern on a jacket that spreads and overlays itself onto other things around the jacket.\n",
            "  - The illusory symptom forms of palinopsia include the following:\n",
            "  - Prolonged afterimage. This is an image that lasts much longer than you’d expect. It usually happens after seeing a bright light or something illuminated by one.\n",
            "  - Light-streaking. This is when either you or a light are moving relative to each other and the light appears to leave behind a bright streak (like a comet tail).\n",
            "  - Visual trailing. This is like light-streaking, but the effect happens on an object rather than a light source.\n",
            "  - Variant image perseveration. This is similar to formed image perseveration, but the images you see can fade after a few seconds. They can also appear as black shapes or seem partially see-through (translucent).\n",
            "Section: What are the most common causes of palinopsia?\n",
            "  - Palinopsia happens when something disrupts vision-related processing in your brain. Many conditions and circumstances can cause that. The most common causes include:\n",
            "  - Migraines. Palinopsia is a possible symptom of migraines, especiallymigraines with auras.\n",
            "  - Seizuresandepilepsy. Focal seizures that affect part of the brain involved in vision processing can cause palinopsia.\n",
            "  - Infections that affect your brain function. An example of this would be posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) that can happen due toCOVID-19.\n",
            "  - Other conditions that affect vision processing. An example of one such condition would bevisual snow syndrome.\n",
            "  - Drugs (see below for more about the types that can cause this).\n",
            "  - Stroke andtransient ischemic attack (TIA). These disrupt blood flow to parts of the brain. Disruptions in arteries that supply the occipital lobe at the back of your head can cause palinopsia.\n",
            "  - Brain lesions.\n",
            "  - Tumors (benign and cancerous).\n",
            "  - Concussionandtraumatic brain injury (TBI).\n",

            "  - Idiopathic (unknown cause).\n",
            "Section: Drugs that can cause palinopsia\n",
            "  - Drug use, either medical or nonmedical, is among the most common causes of palinopsia. And multiple types of drugs can cause it. The most common drug causes include:\n",
            "  - Antidepressants. This includestrazodone,nefazodoneand the tetracyclic antidepressantmirtazapine.\n",
            "  - Antiseizure medications. The most common cause under this type istopiramate, which also sees use for treating migraines.\n",
            "  - Clomiphene. This medication boosts fertility. It’s meant to make a person with ovaries more likely to ovulate.\n",
            "  - Birth control pills (oral contraceptives).\n",
            "  - Antipsychotic medications. The most likely of these isrisperidone.\n",
            "  - Nonmedical drugs. This is especially possible withhallucinogenslike LSD or mescaline.\n",
            "Section: How is palinopsia treated?\n",
            "  - The treatment for palinopsia depends on many factors, especially the underlying cause. Because so many conditions can cause it, the treatment varies widely. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the treatment options for your case and which they recommend.\n",
            "Section: What can I do at home to treat palinopsia?\n",
            "  - Palinopsia isn’t a condition you should self-diagnose or self-treat if you’ve never had it before. This is because palinopsia is a possible symptom of stroke, a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment. Delays in treatment for stroke can lead to permanent brain damage or death.\n",
            "  - Palinopsia that happens briefly may also need emergency medical care. That’s because a transient ischemic attack (TIA) can also cause palinopsia. A TIA is sometimes called a mini-stroke, but it’s more like a temporary version of a stroke. Having a TIA means you have a much higher risk of having a stroke within the coming days, which is why medical treatment is essential even if palinopsia symptoms go away.\n",
            "  - If you have a condition that causes palinopsia that isn’t life-threatening, like seizures or migraines, your neurologist or another healthcare provider can guide you on when you need medical attention. But when in doubt, you should always seek medical attention. Doing so could save your life and spare you from permanent brain damage and loss of abilities.\n",
            "Section: Can palinopsia be prevented?\n",
            "  - Some causes of palinopsia are preventable or avoidable. The best things you can do to avoid it include:\n",
            "  - Wear safety equipment as needed.Head injuries, especially concussions and traumatic brain injuries, can lead to conditions that have palinopsia as a symptom. Wearing safety equipment — especially helmets, head-protecting gear and safety restraints like seatbelts — is vital.\n",
            "  - Manage your chronic conditions. Some conditions like seizures and epilepsy can cause palinopsia. Take your antiseizure medications as prescribed to reduce the chances of having palinopsia or other seizure-related symptoms.\n",
            "  - Take prescription drugs exactly as directed and avoid nonmedical drug use. If you experience palinopsia after taking a prescribed medication, tell the provider who prescribed it. They can help determine if you need a medication change or another adjustment. And always avoid nonmedical drugs like LSD or mescaline.\n",
            "Section: When should palinopsia be treated by a doctor or healthcare provider?\n",
            "  - Since palinopsia might be a symptom of a stroke, you should reach out to a healthcare provider the first time you experience it — even if it’s only temporary. If you have palinopsia along with other stroke symptoms — like a drooping face, muscle weakness or difficulty speaking — you should call 911 (or your local emergency service number) or seek emergency care.\n",
            "  - If a healthcare provider diagnoses you with a non-life-threatening condition that can cause it, like seizures or migraines, they can give you specific guidance. Some causes of palinopsia are ones you can self-treat with as-needed (rescue) or daily preventive medications.\n",
            "  - But even if you have one of those conditions, you might experience palinopsia in a way that’s unexpected or severe. If that happens, it’s best to be cautious and get immediate medical attention.\n",
            "Section: Is there a test for palinopsia?\n",
            "  - There isn’t a test for palinopsia, specifically. A healthcare provider can determine if you have this symptom based on questions they ask you. They may also want to know more about your medical history and any recent happenings that might be contributing.\n",
            "  - Imaging tests likemagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) andCT scans(computed tomography scans), and brain activity tests likeelectroencephalogram (EEG), may help with diagnosing whatever’s causing your palinopsia. They can do that either by detecting brain changes and activity that might indicate palinopsia, or by ruling out other conditions that could cause it. But the tests can vary depending on your symptoms. Your provider can tell you more about the possible causes they suspect and what tests they recommend.\n",
            "Section: What’s the difference between palinopsia and an afterimage?\n",
            "  - Afterimages are a normal effect of how your eyes communicate with your brain. Palinopsia isn’t normal, and it sometimes means something is affecting the part of the brain that processes vision.\n",
            "  - An afterimage is a visual illusion that happens when you stare at something directly for a short time (usually a period of 20-30 seconds) and then stop suddenly by blinking or closing your eyes. You’ll continue to “see” a faint afterimage when your eyes are closed. The image fades within moments.\n",
            "  - Afterimages are often “negative,” meaning dark and light areas are reversed. Others may appear with reversed complementary colors. Red will appear cyan, yellow will appear blue and green will appear magenta, or vice versa. (Optical illusions often take advantage of this effect.)\n",
            "  - Palinopsia appears differently. The images you see are clearer and more vivid than an afterimage, and they’re almost always the same color as the original cause. They can happen immediately or at varying times after you saw the original source of the recurring image.\n",
            "  - A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
            "  - If you have palinopsia, it might seem confusing or alarming at first. But it’s a very real symptom set that experts recognize. It can happen with many conditions, a small number of them dangerous. If you experience it and have never had it before, you should consider getting immediate medical attention. While it could be a symptom of something that isn’t dangerous, it’s best to err on the side of caution.\n",

            "If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, consult your health care provider before using this drug. The risk of birth defects or other serious health problems is greater in women of child-bearing age who use certain prescription drugs, such as this one, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all other medications you use, especially: prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines may interact with other medicines and cause unwanted effects. Ask your doctor before taking any new or any changed medicine. Taking any other medicine while you take dexmedetomidine may increase the risk that you will have a serious or life-threatening side effect, even if you do not have any of these problems with your previous medicine(s). If this happens, tell the doctor right away and stop taking the medicine and call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. If your symptoms persist or get worse, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. What do I do if I miss a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but no later than 2 hours after the dose was taken. Skip the missing dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, unless a doctor tells you to skip it because of another medical condition or if there is a good reason to do so (for example, you feel well and want to continue your usual schedule). Do NOT take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. Doing so may result in dangerously high doses of medicine, which can be harmful or even deadly. WHAT IS DEXMETHIMIDATE? Dexmethimide (Dexmethyltryptamine) is used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (night-time sleep disorder). It is also used in the treatment of obesity, obesity-related disorders (such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome), and obesity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). What is the most important information I should know about Dexmethylamphetamine (DexMeth)? Dexmethylamphetamine is an amphetamine-type stimulant drug that has been used as a treatment for ADHD for more than 30 years. DexMethyl is available in tablet, capsule, liquid, inhaler, chewable, lozenge, suppository, nasal spray, transdermal patch, patch-like device, injection, sublingual, intranasal, oral, rectal and intravenous forms. In the United States, dexmethyl is sold under the brand names Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, Dexedrine, Focalin and Xylocaine. Other names for this product include: Dexamphetamine, D-Methylfentanyl, Methyl-D-L-Threoamphetamine and Methyldihydroamphetamine. How is dex methylated? Dex methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to an amino acid to form a new compound. When the methyl groups are added, the resulting compound is called a \"methylated\" compound, because it has a higher affinity for the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) than the parent compound does. Dopamine is involved in many aspects of human behavior, from learning and memory to motivation and reward. For this reason, many people with ADHD have been prescribed stimulants to help them focus and stay on task. However, there are many other factors that can affect how well a person's brain works and how much they can handle. Some people may need to take more or less of a drug than\n",
